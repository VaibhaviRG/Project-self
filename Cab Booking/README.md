## Introduction

The goal of this challenge is to improve customer service at YourCabs.com, a cab company in Bangalore. Some cab bookings must be cancelled by the company due to unavailability of a car (overbooking). The problem is that cancellations can occur very close to the trip start time, thereby causing inconveniences for the passengers. The task is to predict which cab bookings will most probably be cancelled, given a number of booking attributes.

## Task

The goal of the competition is to create a predictive model for classifying new bookings (described by features such as time of booking, origin and destination of the trip, car Id) as to whether they will eventually get cancelled due to car unavailability. Participants need to upload their predicted likelihoods, and the system will compute the accuracy of these classifications.
