Movie Recommender System using Streamlit
This project implements a movie recommender system using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. The recommender system suggests similar movies based on user-selected preferences using a content-based approach.

Overview
The Movie Recommender System utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie posters and information. It recommends movies similar to the user-selected movie title using cosine similarity scores calculated from movie features.
